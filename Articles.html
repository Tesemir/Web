                        Markus Alexej Persson
                        born 1 June 1979), also known as "Notch",[3] is a Swedish video game programmer
                        and designer. He is the creator of the video game Minecraft, which since its
                        release has become the best-selling video game in history. He founded the video
                        game development company Mojang Studios in 2009.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-family: 'CustomFont';">Persson began developing video games at an early age, making
                        games both
                        professionally and for pleasure for much of his life. His commercial success
                        began after publishing an early version of Minecraft in 2009. Prior to the
                        game's official retail release in 2011, it had sold over ten million copies.
                        After this point, Persson stood down as the lead designer and transferred
                        creative authority to Jens Bergensten. In September 2014, Persson announced
                        on his personal website that he had concluded he "[didn't have the connection
                        to his fans he thought he had]", that he had "become a symbol", and that he
                        did not wish to be responsible for Mojang's increasingly large operation.
                        Persson left Mojang in November of that year, selling his company to Microsoft
                        for a reported US$2.5 billion.[The acquisition made Persson a billionaire.</p>

                    <p style="font-family: 'CustomFont';">Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed and published by
                        Mojang Studios.
                        Originally created by Markus "Notch" Persson using the Java programming language,
                        the first public test build was released on 17 May 2009. The game would continue
                        to be developed over the span of two years, until its full release on 18 November
                        2011. Afterwards, Persson left Mojang and gave Jens "Jeb" Bergensten control over
                        the game's development. In the years since its release, it has been ported to
                        several platforms, including smartphones, tablets, and various video game consoles,
                        primarily by 4J Studios. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property
                        were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Minecraft has become the
                        best-selling video game of all-time, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly
                        140 million monthly active players as of 2023.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-family: 'CustomFont';">In Minecraft, players explore a procedurally generated,
                        three-dimensional world
                        with virtually infinite terrain made up of voxels. Players can discover and
                        extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks,
                        and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs,
                        as well as cooperate with or compete against other players. The game has two main
                        modes; one being survival mode, where players must acquire resources to survive,
                        and a creative mode where players have unlimited resources and the ability to fly.
                        Several other game modes exist besides the two main ones, such as one that allows
                        players to spectate others and one that plays identically to survival mode, but
                        features permadeath. The game's large community also offers a wide variety of
                        user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and
                        custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.</p>
